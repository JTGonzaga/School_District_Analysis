## School_District_Analysis
### Overview of Project:
  This purpose of this project was to analyze a school district's test scores to track statistics for each school and the school district as a whole. The challenge of the project arose when evidence of academic dishonesty was discovered among the ninth graders of Thomas High School. I was assigned to uphold state-testing standards and replace the ninth grade reading and math test results with null values and re-analyze the school district results and report the new results back.
### Results
- Removing the results of the ninth graders at Thomas High School made somewhat small, but noticable differences in the analysis. The overall percent of students passing math went down by 0.20% (from 75% to 74.8%) and the overall percent of students passing math went down 0.03% (from 86% to 85.7%). The percent of overall students passing saw the smallest change of just 0.1% (from 65% to 64.9%). All things considerd, the district was not affected by major margin and the new results for the district are negligable. 
- Unfortunately for Thomas High School, they did not see the same minimal changes as the school district did when their ninth graders were removed. The percent of students passing math went from 93.3% to 66.9%, an overall 26.4% decrease. Reading scores went from 97.1% to 69.7%, an overall 27.4% decrease. The biggest difference I saw was in the overall passing percentage of the school which deacreased from 90.9% to 65%, an overall 25.9% decrease. 
- Removing the results of the ninth graders at Thomas High school showed less of an impact. The percent of students passing math only deacreased 0.2% (from 93.3% to 93.1%). The percent of students passing reading decreased 0.3% (from 97.3% to 97%). The decrease in overall students passing saw a 0.31% decrease (from 90.94% to 90.63%). 
### Replacing the ninth grade scores affected:
- Math and Reading Scores by grade:
  The only group affected by this change were the ninth graders at Thomas High School as their results were all changed to 0. The other schools were not affected in any grade. 
- Scores by School Spending:
  
- Scores by School Size:
  
- Scores by School Type:
