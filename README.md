## School_District_Analysis
### Overview of Project:
  This purpose of this project was to analyze a school district's test scores to track statistics for each school and the school district as a whole. The challenge of the project arose when evidence of academic dishonesty was discovered among the ninth graders of Thomas High School. I was assigned to uphold state-testing standards and replace the ninth grade reading and math test results with null values and re-analyze the school district results and report the new results back.
### Results
- Removing the results of the ninth graders at Thomas High School made somewhat small, but noticable differences in the analysis. The overall percent of students passing math went down by 0.20% (from 75% to 74.8%) and the overall percent of students passing math went down 0.03% (from 86% to 85.7%). The percent of overall students passing saw the smallest change of just 0.1% (from 65% to 64.9%). All things considerd, the district was not affected by major margin and the new results for the district are negligable. 
- Unfortunately for Thomas High School, they did not see the same minimal changes as the school district did when their ninth graders were removed. The percent of students passing math went from 93.3% to 66.9%, an overall 26.4% decrease. Reading scores went from 97.1% to 69.7%, an overall 27.4% decrease. The biggest difference I saw was in the overall passing percentage of the school which deacreased from 90.9% to 65%, an overall 25.9% decrease. 
- Removing the results of the ninth graders at Thomas High school showed less of an impact. The percent of students passing math only deacreased 0.2% (from 93.3% to 93.1%). The percent of students passing reading decreased 0.3% (from 97.3% to 97%). The decrease in overall students passing saw a 0.31% decrease (from 90.94% to 90.63%). 
### Replacing the ninth grade scores affected:
- Math and Reading Scores by grade:
  The only group affected by this change were the ninth graders at Thomas High School as their results were all changed to 0. The other schools were not affected in any grade. 
- Scores by School Spending:

  ![After](https://github.com/JTGonzaga/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/after.png)
  The scores based on school spending were only affected in the $631-$645 row because that's the range that Thomas High School falls into. As you can see by the charts, the aerage math score went down from 79.1 to 78.5, the average readings score went down from an 81.9 to an 81.6. The biggest changes we se are in the percentages. % passing math went down 3%, % passing reading went down 2%, and % overall passing went down 3%
- Scores by School Size:

![size_after](https://github.com/JTGonzaga/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/size_after.png)
  The overall scores by school size were not affected much by the changes due to Thomas High School. The average math and reading score were both decreased by a fraction of a percent. The percent of passing math, passing reading, and overall passing were affected by 0.01%, 0.06%, and 0.07% respectively. 
- Scores by School Type:

![type_after](https://github.com/JTGonzaga/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/type_after.png)
  The overall scores by school type were not affected to a reasonable degree. Rounding to the nearest whole number did not show any signifigant distinction.
## Summary
  As a district, there were not many distinguishable differences to the data as a whole in terms of the changes brought about by the academic dishonesty of the ninth graders of Thomas High School. The only major differences were seen when analyzing Thomas High School's statistics. Scores by school size, type or spending were not affected to a meaningful degree. The biggest changes were to the math and reading scores by grade which mostly only affected Thomas High School. Even the scores of the district as a whole did not seem to be impacted in any sort of major way.
