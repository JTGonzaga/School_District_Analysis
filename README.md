## School_District_Analysis
### Overview of Project:
  This purpose of this project was to analyze a school district's test scores to track statistics for each school and the school district as a whole. The challenge of the project arose when evidence of academic dishonesty was discovered among the ninth graders of Thomas High School. I was assigned to uphold state-testing standards and replace the ninth grade reading and math test results with null values and re-analyze the school district results and report the new results back.
